Hey, I'm just a software developer looking to make a difference in the world via Open Source.

<p>
I'm mostly interested in creating free, open source applications.
My current language obsession is Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/) which you should definitely check out if you haven't already.
</p>

<p>
I'm also diving pretty hard into exploring Godot (https://godotengine.org/) at the moment.
