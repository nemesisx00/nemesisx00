Hey, I'm just a disillusioned software developer looking to find solace in Open Source.

<p>
I'm mostly interested in creating free, open source applications.
My current language obsession is Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/) which you should definitely check out if you haven't already.
</p>

<p>
I'm diving pretty hard into Godot (https://godotengine.org/) at the moment.
