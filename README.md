Hey, I'm @nemesisx00

<p>
I'm mostly interested in creating free, open source applications.
My current language obsession is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) which you should definitely check out if you haven't already.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently learning desktop application development in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) via [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/)
as well as game development with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
