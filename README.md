Hey, I'm just a software developer looking to make a difference in the world via Open Source.

I've worked with all sorts of languages and other technologies throughout my career. To name some of the big ones: C#, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, Rust. Currently, I'm mostly interested in using my free time to create free, open source applications. If you haven't yet, I recommend looking into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) because it's pretty cool.

My initial motivator for getting into software development was a desire to create games. Thanks to [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) I am able to explore game development with a high quality, completely open source game engine. I also find it to be considerably more intuitive than other options. Version 4.0 is on the immediate horizon so now is a great time to jump in and start learning!
