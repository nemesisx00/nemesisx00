Hey, I'm just a software developer looking to make a difference in the world via Open Source.

I've worked with all sorts of languages and other technologies throughout my career.
To name some of the big ones: [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [Java](https://openjdk.org/), [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript), [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
If you haven't yet, I recommend looking into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) because
it's pretty cool. I won't list everything I've ever worked with because... oof, that's
a very long list and it would be just as boring to read as it would be for me to write.
Currently, I'm mostly interested in using my free time to create free, open source applications.

My initial motivation for getting into software development was a desire to create games.
Thanks to [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) I am able to explore game development with a
high quality, completely open source game engine. I also find it to be considerably more
intuitive than other options.
